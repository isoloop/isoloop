# Would like

Ideas we've consciously deferred or want to explore later. None of them is planned or promised: an item moves into a milestone plan only when a user asks for it, or a milestone shows it's needed, and then it gets an ADR if it changes a decision. Each entry links the ADR that deferred it.

## Bus and contracts

- **Async seed `map`.** Let a seed's `map` return a promise, for migrations that need I/O. Deferred because it puts the network on the seed's path inside the bus worker; the migrator-isolate pattern covers it today. ([ADR 0003](adr/0003-schema-format-standard-schema.md))
- **`kernel.reseed(topic)`.** Re-run the current `map` over the v1 offsets a seed rejected, once the `map` or the schema is fixed. The offsets are already kept in the seed metadata. ([ADR 0003](adr/0003-schema-format-standard-schema.md))
- **`migrator(from, to, map)` helper.** A ~20-line helper in `@isoloop/runtime` that builds the migrator isolate for migrations a seed can't express. ([ADR 0003](adr/0003-schema-format-standard-schema.md))
- **`isoloop contracts check --against <ref>`.** Detect breaking schema changes within a topic version by diffing exported JSON Schema. Today it's a CI review of the diff. ([ADR 0003](adr/0003-schema-format-standard-schema.md))
- **Hot contract reload.** `kernel.reloadContracts()` for long-lived tabs that outlive a deploy. Needs validation against two versions at once. ([ADR 0003](adr/0003-schema-format-standard-schema.md))

## Routing

- **Path-glob navigate grants.** `grants.navigate: string[]` matched against `path`, with `true` meaning `['*']`. Today `onNavigate` with `req.from` covers path rules. ([ADR 0002](adr/0002-host-owns-routing.md))
- **`back`/`go(n)` host call.** Hard to veto beforehand, gives no result, and may leave the app. ([ADR 0002](adr/0002-host-owns-routing.md))
- **Detecting host navigations without wiring.** Use the Navigation API's `currententrychange` where available, as an option on top of `kernel.syncRoute()`. ([ADR 0002](adr/0002-host-owns-routing.md))
- **Isolates owning URL segments.** The micro-frontend router model. ([ADR 0002](adr/0002-host-owns-routing.md))
